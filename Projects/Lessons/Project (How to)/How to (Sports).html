<h1>How to</h1>
<h2>Sports to play unofficially</h2>


<h2 id="baseball">Baseball</h2>
<p>First you need to know what you will need to play</p>
<li>A bat</li>
<li>Nine baseball gloves</li>
<li>A Baseball</li>
<li>Nine friends</li>
<li>Bases</li>
<p>Have nine people take their positions in the field. Three in the outfield (The big grass part). Four on the infeild (The dirt). One on the Pitchers mound (The hill). One behind home plate.
</p>

<p>After everyone has taken their position on the field, give the ball to the player in the "pitcher" position.
    The player not in the feild then proceids to pick up the bat and wait at home plate. Once the pitcher is ready the batter will line up with the home plate and get ready to swing. With everyone ready, the pitcher throws the ball in front of the batter. 
    The batter then proceids to try and hit the ball with the bat.
    When the batter hits the ball, the people in the field do their best to try and catch it in their glove, while the batter starts running to first base.
    If a feilder catches the ball mid air, than the batter is "out".
    If the ball is not caught than the fielders throw the ball to first base trying to beat the runner.
    The person at first base catches the ball and tries to touch fist base before the runner does.
    If the runner gets there first he is "safe" <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/18/17/14/athletes-1835893_1280.jpg" width="300" height="300"/></id> but if the feilder with the ball touches the base first, then the runner is "out".
    Usually this is done with two teams of at least eight people, but in this case it would just be for fun.
    If you continue to play with only ten players than it will proceed as stated above with different people taking turns batting.
    The winner is whoever has the most times around oll of the bases in one hit or whoever has the most over the fence hits.

<p>How to play football!</p>


<h3>Setup:</h3> 
<p>Minimum amount of players = 8 players</p>

<p>First, you need to divide your players into teams (Four on four). 
    Once you have your teams decided, then give your player there position.
    There are three different positions for Offense and three for Defense.</p><img src= "./80ga8upn.png" width="300" height="150"/>

    <h3>Offense</h3>
    <li>Quater Back (The guy who throws the ball)</li>
    <li>Wide Receiver (The guy who catches the ball)</li>
    <li>Offensive Lineman (The guy who protects the Quater Back)</li>
   
    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/01/28/03/16/american-football-3959528_1280.jpg"width= 350 length= 650/>

    <h3>Defense</h3>
    <li>Defensive Lineman (The guy who tries to tackle the Quater Back)</li>
    <li>Corner (The guy who tries to prevent the Wide Receiver from catching the ball)</li><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/01/28/03/16/american-football-3959528_1280.jpg"width= 350 length= 650/>
    <li>Safety (This guy hangs far back and makes sure the Receivers dont get the ball)</li>

    <p>There are three things you need to know</p>
    <li>If the ball touches the ground than the play is over</li>
    <li> The line of scrimage is the place the ball was downed in the previous play</li>
    <li>As a wide Receiver, you cannot do something to dirrectly affect the Receiver when he is trying to catch the ball. Exa. Pushing, Pulling, Tackling, Or Jumping on top of.</li>

        <p>After you have chosen everyones positions, line up in the correct formation:
            
            <li>Offensive Lineman: On the line of scrimage, facing the direction of which the offense is trying to go (Towards the touchdown). </li>
            <li>Quarter Back: He lines up directly behind the Offensive line man (His protecter) and starts with the ball.</li>
            <li>Wide Receivers: These two guys line up to the far right and left of the Offensive Lineman on the line of scrimage </li>
            <li>Defensive Lineman: This man lines up dirrectly in front of the Offensive Lineman, and faces him.</li>
            <li>Corners: Line up dirrectly in front of the Wide Receivers, again, facing toward them.</li>
            <li>Safety: The Safety lines up far behind the Defensive Lineman. </li>
        </p>
    
        <p>To start the play, the Quarter Back yells hike. When the Wide Receivers here that, they run toward the touchdown trying to get open through various directional changes of their choice.
            It is then the Quarter Backs job to throw the ball to the Receiver when he is open. The receiver tries to catch the ball, and if he succeeds, he than runs to the touchdown trying not to get tackled.
            While all of this is happening the Defensive Lineman is trying to get passed the Offensive Lineman to tackle the Quarter Back before he throws the ball.
            The Offensive Lineman is Trying to prevent the Defensive Lineman from getting to the Quarter Back.
            The safety sits back and wates to judge where he thinks the ball will go.
            The safety then either attempts to catch the ball, knock it down, or tackle the receiver that caught it.
            In the event that a corner or safety catches the ball, he will run to the oposite touchdown that the offense is trying to get to. This is called an interception
            The game goes on for four quarters made up of ten minuets each.
            In the case that a touchdown is made, than the opposite team starts at the one fifth line on the feild with the ball.

    <h2 id ="basketball">Basketball</h2>

    <p>Basketball, like the other sports on this page, is a very fun and fast paced game.
        I will now explain how to play basketball.
    </p>

<h3>What you will need</h3>

<li>Basketball</li>

<li>Court</li>

<li>A hoop</li>

<li>An even number of people up to ten</li>

<p>The first thing that you need to know, is the goal.
    the goal of basketball is to get as many points as you can.
    The way to earn points is by throwing or "shooting" the ball into the basket or "hoop". 
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>In order to start playing you will need to pick teams based off of skill and height.
    Once you have picked the teams, you will need to decide who gets the ball first.
    Do this in any way you want.
    The team that starts with the ball will than try to score on their designated hoop.
(You only do this if you have a full court with two basckets).
    The one team tries to shoot the ball into the hoop, while the other tries to defend the hoop.
    Now, their are a lot of rules, and they might sound complicated, but stay with me.
</p>

<h2>Dribling</h2>

<li>Basic rules</li>
<p>You cannot move without dribling.
    Although, you are allowed two steps without dribling after you pick up the ball from dribling.
    I know, complicated.
</p>

<h2>Fouls of dribbling</h2>
<li>A Travel: When you take more than two steps without dribling.
    You start walking before dribling.</li>

<li>Double Drible</li>
