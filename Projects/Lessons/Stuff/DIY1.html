<h1>The story of Karen</h1>

<p>So, it was the year 2077, and war was present. A certain someone named YOUR MOM rose to the occasion. With the power of turning any yo mama joke into reality this was the Karen’s chance to end the war. The war had been going on for over thirty years now with no clear end in sight. The Karen’s had been screaming their lungs out, playing fake injuries, enforcing the rules of THEIR neighborhood, and even standing in parking spots to save them for fellow Karens. The “Trouble Makers”, as the Karens liked to call them, or TM for short were having much trouble making any headway. The Karens had set up base of operations in the desert, where they used their Karen cut as camouflage. It was hard to spot them. General Common Sense had spent quite a while trying to figure out how to beat the Karens with little to no progress. Tension had been building as the Karens were growing very powerful. The TM had successfully caught many Karens, and were running experiments on them to try and find a way to fight back, until one day. A young scientist by the name of Dr. Down to Earth had made an amazing discovery! They needed to fight fire with fire. If a fight between a Karen and non-Karen broke out all the non-Karen would have to do is scream louder than the Karen! This would result in the Karen getting frustrated to the point where their brain would shut down and they would become mindless zombies. Although, now the question was how to deal with Your Mom? At last, a solution came to mind. If General Common Sense could turn Your Mom against the Karens there would be no competition. So, with the new plan in mind they set out to end the war once and for all. They sent troops to the location of your mom armed with megaphones. The troops instructions were to tell Your Mom, who does not like to be bossed around, “The Karens are trying to control you.” After this was said, the Karen immediately turned on the Karens. Of course, this made the Karens furious they screamed at the troops with all their might, but it was no use. The megaphones had blocked out everything the Karens was saying. It worked! All of the Karens instantly fell to their knees in lack of brain power. The TMs had won!</p>
